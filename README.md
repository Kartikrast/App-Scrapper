In this project I have created a complete automation
process to scrape the data from the instagram
accounts. As many small business owners are self
employeed professionals always need leads for the
outreach of their business, however to manully
collect the leads is a very hectic tast, hence using this
program they will be able to automate this process.
This program will do the following tasks:-
User only need to input their device details such
as:-
Adb device name
Android Version
Number of Leads they want
Search hashtag
The program will start from the home screen.
Then it will open instagram.
It will move to the search screen.
It will enter the search tag in the search bar.
Then once the results are available
It will move to the “Posts” section and will start
visiting the account of each post.
From the account it will gather these infos:-
Username
No. of Followers
No. of Following
Email &Phone No. if the contact button is there.
In this version, the program will only pick the unique
accounts, otherwise it will move to the next post,
hence only collecting the data of unique accounts. In
this version the program will start from the posts
section only, however in the upcoming versions we
can get the input from the user weather they want to
start scraping the data from the posts or account
section.
The program will collect the data in respected
variables and once the scrapping is completed, it will
give you all the data into an Excel file.
You will be able to see the complete video on the
working of the program, on my linkedIn page, and the
link for the video is given on the cover page.
I am sure there can be many improvements in this
program that can be done, if you feel like contributing
